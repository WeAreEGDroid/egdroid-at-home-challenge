## Installation
### Cloning this repository
This repository contains [submodules](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules).

Git expects us to explicitly ask it to download the submodule's content. You can use `git submodule update --init --recursive` here as well, but if you're cloning this repository for the first time, you can use a modified clone command to ensure you download everything, including any submodules:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:eg-droid/egdroid-at-home-challenge.git
```

###  Updating latest changes from submodules
In order to updated the repository submodules content, you can execute the following command regularly:

```
git submodule update --remote --recursive
```
